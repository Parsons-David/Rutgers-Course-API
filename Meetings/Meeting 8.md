# Meeting 8

## Updates

Wrote a bunch of code to modularize DB connection.   

Didn't test it till last night.    

Code does not work. :(   

Modularization is a bigger task then I anticipated, need to think it out more.

OOP vs Parameter Passing

## Future

Robotics is over on Saturday. Free from anything but work.

3 full weeks of just school work remaining.

Final Stop Date? Before or After Finals?

Need to set harder goals for the next 3 weeks.

**Query Structure**
