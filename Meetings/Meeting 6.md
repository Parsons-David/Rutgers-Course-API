## Concerns

105 *Failures* - are really just returning empty arrays.
  - This means that there is either a bug in in rusoc or some data given by the subjects.json is misleading
  - User more Complex HTTP Requests to check headers.
  - Create White-list?

Working to add references
  - Required rewriting parsing script

Come up with big goal for Spring Break.
