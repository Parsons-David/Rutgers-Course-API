Updates

**Paid Cluster**    
Provides Several Useful tools like GUI to view Data.   
Connection Statistics, etc, privatizes data.   
Not much space will be needed an Estimate could be found   

**Threading Loads**   
How this might effect connections, what sharing the connection object across a thread might do.   
Maybe create a pool, of JSON Collectors and then threads spawned to load the Data.   
Proper Design of a threaded IO.
