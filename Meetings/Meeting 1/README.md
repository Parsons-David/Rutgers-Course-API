## Concerns

**Database**
  - Several Options
    - MongoDB
      - Non-Relational, easy to use, prior experience, works well with JSON
      - Issues with connections from Lambdas
      - No experience with joins
    - DynamoDB
      - Free with AWS
      - Non-Relational, but not in the same way as MongoDB
      - Not as easy to manage, queries maybe be harder to perform
      - Built to scale for large Data sets, might not be the best for this use case
    - RDS
      - Can use any Relational DB
      - Some experience with Relational DBs
      - queries can get ugly real-quick
      - may still have same connection management issues as Mongo
