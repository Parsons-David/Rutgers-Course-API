# Meeting 8

## Updates

In a great place with the rest of my course load.

Time during Detroit Trip.

**Query Design**
Laid ground work for design with query.json

query.json
  - Defines Query Types
  - Can be named anything
    - Can be given mongo query params and options
    - Can have a variable amount of params
  - Query types can then be assigned to keys in config.json
  - Default query type is one isn't defined or implemented.

## Future

Define Query Structure - *Medium Difficulty*

Implement Query Structure - *Easy Difficulty*

Implement Endpoints (AWS) - *Medium Difficulty*

**BEFORE I LEAVE FOR DETROIT**

Implement full API - *Easy - Medium Difficulty*
  - This should be as easy as updating the single JSON
  - And adding some augmenting methods

Documentation - *Easy Difficulty*
